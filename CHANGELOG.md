# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] - 2026-10-10

### Added

- `email.send_delayed` and `broadcast.batch_completed` in `EVENT_TYPES` (and in
  `EMAIL_EVENTS` / `BROADCAST_EVENTS`), matching the server (Broadcast 2.43.0).
  `email.send_delayed` fires when a transactional email waits for room under
  its server's hourly limit.
- `excluded_segment_ids` on broadcasts, sequences and autopilots: segments a
  send never reaches. The server refuses a segment that is both sent to and
  excluded with 422.
- `subscribers.create(unsubscribed_at=...)`: creates a subscriber who has
  already unsubscribed, in one request, with any token. Before, the server
  ignored the field and a migration had to create, then unsubscribe.

- `TRIGGER_FREQUENCIES`: the words `trigger_settings["frequency"]` accepts
  (`always`, `every_visit`, `once_per_session`, `once_per_day`,
  `once_per_week`, `once`).

### Changed

- Opt-in forms: the server now refuses an unknown `trigger_settings`
  frequency word with 422 (`ValidationError`). Before, it saved any word, and
  an unknown one showed the popup on every visit. The client still sends what
  it is given.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-06

### Added

- `client.topics` for `/api/v1/topics` (subscriber topics): `list`, `get`,
  `create`, `update`, `delete`. Topics use the subscriber permissions.
  Broadcasts and sequences accept `topic_id`.
- `subscribers.update(email, custom_data_mode="merge", ...)`: change only the
  custom_data keys sent; `None` deletes a key. The default stays replace.
- `subscriber.preferences_updated` webhook event type, in `SUBSCRIBER_EVENTS`
  and `EVENT_TYPES` (now 35).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- `client.migration.unsubscribed_emails()` for
  `GET /api/migration/v1/unsubscribed_emails`, the channel's own suppression
  list; `each_record("unsubscribed_emails")` pages it. `suppressions` returns
  only the global suppression list, so an export needs both.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-25

### Added
- `subscribers.purged` and `subscribers.purge_failed` webhook event types, in
  `SUBSCRIBER_EVENTS` and `EVENT_TYPES` (now 34). A purge of the whole list
  sends one of these instead of a `subscriber.deleted` per subscriber.
- `client.channel_design.get()` for `GET /api/v1/channel/design`: the token
  channel's brand kit (colours, font and font stack, layout, logo URL, website
  and social links), fully resolved and read-only. Needs `templates_read`.
- `client.users` resource for the admin-only Users API: `list`, `get`,
  `create`, `update`, `deactivate`, `activate`, `delete`,
  `channel_permissions`, `set_channel_permissions` (PUT, replaces the whole
  channel record; requires exactly one of `permissions`/`role`/`preset_id`),
  `remove_channel_permissions`, `bulk_channel_permissions`,
  `system_permissions`, `update_system_permissions`. Requires an admin API
  token; sudo users are read-only and sudo access can never be granted
  through the API. Adds `BaseResource._put`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-28

Published to PyPI as `broadcast-python`; the import module is `broadcast_python`,
because a package named `broadcast` already occupies that name on PyPI.

Released through PyPI trusted publishing (OIDC) rather than an API token — no
credential for this package exists anywhere. Verified from the registry: the
installed artifact imports, ships `py.typed`, exposes all 18 migration
collections and 32 event types, and computes a webhook signature identical to
the Ruby, PHP and Node SDKs.


First release. Feature parity with `broadcast-ruby` v0.3.0 — the reference
implementation — verified at **104/104 API operations** by the coverage report
in the `broadcast` repo.

### Transport
- Required explicit `host`, with `BROADCAST_HOST` / `BROADCAST_API_TOKEN` env
  fallbacks matching the Broadcast CLI's config keys
- Bearer auth, `User-Agent: broadcast-python/<version>`
- Response warnings surfaced, with `log` / `raise` / `ignore` modes
- `Idempotency-Key` request header and `idempotent_replay` detection
- `X-RateLimit-*` parsing; 429 retry honouring `Retry-After`, bounded by
  `max_retry_delay`
- Retries on timeout and 5xx with linear backoff; 422 is never retried
- Typed errors for 401/403/404/409/422/429/5xx
- Redirects followed on GET only, never across hosts — the request carries a
  bearer token, and urllib's default handler would take it along
- Raw response path for `text/plain` (`/api/v1/skill`) and binary file assets
- Channel scoping via `broadcast_channel_id` and the `with_channel` context manager
- Debug logging that never emits credentials or request bodies

### Resources
Subscribers, broadcasts (incl. statistics), sequences (incl. steps), segments,
templates, opt-in forms, email servers, webhook endpoints, transactionals,
autopilot, discovery, and the 20 migration/export operations.

### Non-negotiables carried over from the Ruby gem
- **Credential redaction guard** on email servers and autopilot, so a
  fetch-modify-save cannot overwrite a real credential with bullet characters
- Webhook HMAC-SHA256 verification with a 5-minute window and constant-time
  comparison
- No credentials or subscriber emails in debug output

### Notes
- No runtime dependencies. The transport is `urllib` from the standard library,
  so installing this cannot conflict with a pinned `requests` or `httpx`.
- The test suite uses `unittest`, so it runs with no test dependencies either.
- `broadcast.TimeoutError` shadows neither the builtin nor `socket.timeout`; it
  is named for parity with the Ruby gem and pinned by a test.
